# Learning-Service

This application was built using mainly ReactJS with Firebase, Firestore backend. This app allows the tutors to be able to offer their teaching services. In addition, the students can find out the services that they want to get help with.
Technologies used in this app:
- ReactJS
- Redux.
- Firebase, Firestore.
- HTML, CSS, Bulma CSS.
- and much more.

What I have learned during this progress of building this application:
- React, Redux, Redux-Thunk, Middleware, Higher Order Component, Authentication, etc

### Workflow of this application:
1. The tutor can create the services.
2. The student can make an offer for the service that they want (how many hours do they want).
3. After that, the tutor can accept/decline the offer.
4. If they accept the offer, the student can join the collaboration anytime.
5. When the student join the collaboration, the tutor will get the notification about that.
6. When they start the collaboration, they can send the messages to each other. The time will also count down.
7. When the time is up, the system will automatically ends the collaboration. They cannot interact with each other anymore.

### Set up the application:
1. Open your terminal and run the following commands:
2. git clone https://github.com/tricaodo/Learning-Service-ReactApp.git
3. npm install
4. Open the package.json and change "start": "node server.js" to "start": "react-scripts start",
5. npm start to run the application
