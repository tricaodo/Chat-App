# Learning-Service

This application was built using mainly ReactJS with Firebase, Firestore backend. This app allows the tutors to be able to offer their teaching services. In addition, the students can find out the services that they want to get help with.
Technologies used in this app:
- ReactJS
- Redux.
- Firebase, Firestore.
- HTML, CSS, Bulma CSS.
- and much more.

What I have learned during this progress of building this application:
- React, Redux, Redux-Thunk, Middleware, Higher Order Component, Authentication, etc

### Workflow of this application:
1. Tutors can create services.
2. A student can make an offer for the service they want from a tutor (how many hours, etc.) Tutor can accept or decline studentâ€™s offer.
3. If the tutor accepts the offer, the student can join a collaboration with the tutor at any time. When the student joins the collaboration, the tutor will receive a notification.
4. If they accept the offer, the student can join the collaboration anytime.
5. When they start the collaboration, time will count down.
6. When the time is up, the system will automatically end the collaboration & tutor and student will no longer be able to interact with each other.

### Set up the application:
1. Open your terminal and run the following commands:
2. git clone https://github.com/tricaodo/Learning-Service-ReactApp.git
3. npm install
4. Open the package.json and change "start": "node server.js" to "start": "react-scripts start",
5. npm start to run the application
